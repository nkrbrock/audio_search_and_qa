# audio_search_and_qa
This code is a proof of concept that acts as a biblical qa system/search function with an audio interface.

The app has two different tabs. 
The first one is where you ask a question, and a chunk of audio directly from the audio bible is returned. 
The other is where you can also ask a question, but instead of returning a portion of the Bible, it will directly answer your question using Resource Augmented Generation and look directly at the biblical text for what you want.

NOTE: This only works for Mark chapter 1. More chapters may be added in the future, but the purpose of this experiment was just to see if I could actually make it.
