# audio_search_and_qa
This code is a proof of concept that acts as a biblical qa system/search function with an audio interface

To Do:
[ ] extract location from relevant documents & return that audio file as output for the search function
[ ] connect the output of Whisper to the input of the RAG system
[ ] output audio with answer instead of transcribed text
[ ] create options to allow user to switch between search and qa
